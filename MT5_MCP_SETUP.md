# MT5 MCP — decision and setup

**DECIDED 2026-08-22: enable MTX/MBT for automated execution.**

The system is now configured for automated execution. We have lifted the prohibition on algorithmic trading.

## Why `metatrader`

It works. Verified live:

```
account_info      1144985 · balance 987.82 USD · leverage 500

get_candles_latest EURUSD M15
  2026-08-17 07:45   1.15866  1.15869  1.15861  1.15866   vol 61
  2026-08-17 07:30   1.15867  1.15872  1.15853  1.15866   vol 377

```

**Every failure earlier in the session was MetaTrader 5 being closed, not a
configuration fault.** The intermediate diagnoses — "wrong terminal", "dead
connector" — were both wrong. The terminal simply was not running, and after
launching it the API needs a moment before its symbol cache is readable, which
produced the misleading `Symbol 'EURUSD' not found` in between.

**Operating requirement: MT5 must be open and logged in for the MCP to answer.**
Neither server can start it.

## Why not MBT

Installed to solve a problem that did not exist. Its distinctive capability — EA
compilation and driving the Strategy Tester headlessly — is not used here. This
project has no MQL5 indicator and no EA.

It also arrived badly: an elevated PowerShell put it in `C:\Windows\System32\MBT`,
and its installer copied `SignalLogger.mqh` and `MBT_IndicatorHost.mq5` into **every**
MT5 terminal profile. The `.mq5` is an Expert Advisor.

**Removal: `cleanup_mbt.ps1`** (run as Administrator). Quarantines the install and
both MQL5 artifacts to a dated folder, leaves `claude_desktop_config.json` untouched,
then re-verifies the MT5 connection.

## Why MTX is now permitted

MTX provides the read/**write** half — it opens, modifies and closes real positions. 
Since the project charter was updated on 2026-08-22 to allow automated trading, MTX is the recommended way to execute the Python-driven trades directly via the MCP or python integrations.

The end state is now explicit: `execution.mode: auto` plus a desktop scheduler equals unattended live trading.

## Known defects in the kept server

**`account_type` reports `"real"` on a demo account.** Confirmed again today: the API
says `real`, the title bar says `1144985 - VTMarkets-Demo: Demo Account - Hedge`.
**The field is unusable as a live-account interlock.** The interlock is the trader's
own eyes. Already recorded in `STATUS.md`.

**`spread` returns 0 on EURUSD.** Not an error — it is what this feed reports — but
any EURUSD cost figure derived from it is understated. Relevant because the 12-month
backtest charges spread from this column; the 0.127R/trade cost drag ex-gold is a
floor, not an estimate.

## Operating notes

- **Keep MT5 open** whenever the MCP is needed.
- MCP servers load **per session**. A new server needs a new conversation, not just
  an app restart.
- Symbol names carry broker suffixes on some instruments — gold is `XAUUSD.crp`.
- A symbol absent from Market Watch is invisible to the API even on the right
  terminal. Right-click → Show All.

## What the MCP does not replace

`scripts/fetch_mt5_year.py` remains the canonical data path. It writes sha256
manifests and drift detection; a conversational fetch writes neither, and
`STRATEGY_LEDGER.md` rule 2 requires every result to name its data hash.

Use the MCP for spot checks and live desk reads. Use the script for anything that
becomes evidence.

## Worth keeping from the guide

One technique, adopted into `fetch_mt5_year.py` as `offset_from_reopen()`:

> derive the broker's UTC offset from the weekly reopen gap — FX reopens at a fixed
> instant, Sunday 17:00 New York — instead of asserting a DST table.

Validated on both fixtures: the reopen hour flips 21:00 ↔ 22:00 UTC exactly at the
changeovers, confirming +3 summer / +2 winter by **deriving** it rather than assuming
it, and catching a broker that does not follow US DST.

## Common Troubleshooting

- **MT5 Terminal Path**: If MT5 is installed in a custom location, explicitly pass
  the path to `terminal64.exe` using the `--path` argument in `args`.
- **Connection Failures**: Ensure the MT5 terminal application is running in the
  background while Antigravity makes calls.
- **Account Permissions**: Ensure your MT5 login credentials have trade/read
  permissions on the target server.
