# Risk and Position Sizing

Sizing transforms signals into portfolio risk. Treat it as a separate, testable layer.

## Inputs

Require:

- account/base currency and simulated capital;
- instrument P&L conventions;
- signal scale and rebalance timing;
- volatility/covariance estimator and its observation lag;
- liquidity measure and participation limit;
- gross, net, per-name, sector, asset-class, and leverage limits;
- cost and margin assumptions.

## Workflow

1. Start with a transparent baseline such as equal notional or equal risk.
2. If volatility targeting is used, define lookback, estimator, floor, cap, annualization, and lag.
3. Convert target risk to units using the correct multiplier and currency conversion.
4. Round to valid lot/contract sizes, then recompute actual risk.
5. Apply constraints in a documented order.
6. Model cash, collateral, financing, and margin conservatively.
7. Cap size by realistic liquidity/participation.
8. Stress volatility spikes, correlation convergence, gaps, funding changes, and reduced liquidity.
9. Attribute performance changes to signal quality versus sizing.

## Guardrails

- Avoid martingale, loss-doubling, or uncapped averaging-down rules.
- Do not infer safety from low historical volatility alone.
- Use lagged, point-in-time estimates.
- Treat drawdown stops as strategy changes requiring separate validation.
- Never hide leverage created by derivatives or cross-currency exposure.

## Output

Produce:

- sizing equation and all units;
- estimator definitions and lags;
- ordered constraint pipeline;
- before/after exposures and risk contributions;
- turnover and cost impact;
- stress scenarios;
- cases where no position should be taken due to missing or unreliable inputs.
